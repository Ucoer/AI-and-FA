* The unizpped dataset is 465 GB and is too large to upload into drive, so 5 folders are provided as example, which includes CT scans and a thin bone nii.gz file. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17QWb6SeXOug1H7M4bcnpkyJn09MyMyH-?usp=drive_link
* The unzipping, cleaning, and converting DCM to NIfTI processes are based on and adapted from the preprocessing_pipeline (S1, S2 and S4) by Martin Lo, https://github.com/MartinLLo/preprocessing_pipeline
